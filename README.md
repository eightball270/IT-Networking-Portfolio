# ðŸ“¡ IT Networking Portfolio
## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hi, my name is Muhammad Iqbal Perdana, an IT support enthusiast at heart, I'm increasingly fascinated by the power of well-designed and maintained networks. This portfolio illustrates my dedication to mastering both the art of user support and the science of network functionality. I'm eager to contribute my growing networking skills to create more efficient and reliable IT environments.

This repository showcases networking projects built using Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3, simulating networks with Cisco and MikroTik devices. It covers configurations from basic peer-to-peer setups to intermediate routing and switching tasks, including DHCP (server and relay), VLANs, static and dynamic routing, NAT for internet access, and remote access setup via Telnet and SSH on both routers and switches.
